# ReferralXpert
 ReferralXpert is a powerful and versatile plugin for Minecraft Servers, that allows users to create and manage a referral system within their server. With this plugin, players can generate referral codes and earn rewards when new players join the server using their codes. This and much more!

## Work in progress
The plugin is still in a decidedly primitive stage of development. For this reason, it does not yet have all the features and optimizations, which will be released at the end of the project, as well as at the official release of the first version.
